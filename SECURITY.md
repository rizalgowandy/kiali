# Security Policy
Kiali takes security seriously and encourages users to report security concerns.

If you run a security scan on Kiali software that automatically generates a list of potential vulnerabilities and would like to report this security scan report to the Kiali team, we ask that you first verify that your scan is correctly validating the latest release and that the list of results is valid, contains no duplicates, and the reported vulnerabilities truly affect Kiali. Security report investigation often takes priority over scheduled work and can be time consuming for the Kiali maintainers to research and validate. So, please verify that your submitted report accurately reflects the Kiali software being scanned, and that the reported security issue(s) actually affect Kiali or one of its dependencies.
