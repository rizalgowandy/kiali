= Kiali UI

== Introduction

A UI for the Kiali Istio Observability Project

== Quick Start
[source,shell]
----
# Get the kiali-ui sources
git clone https://github.com/kiali/kiali.git
cd kiali/frontend

# Install Yarn
npm install -g yarn

# Install kiali-ui dependencies
yarn install

# Start a development server
yarn start
----

[NOTE]
On some platforms, `yarn start` may fail with an error like `Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached`. To fix this, you need to increase the limit of file watchers on your system. The command may vary depending on the platform, please refer to link:https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers[these instructions].

A new browser window should automatically open.
But, if it doesn't then use: `http://localhost:3000`
(or whatever address is told by the `yarn start` command).

This launches a development environment that instantly
reloads any changes to the browser for rapid development.

== Developing

The Kiali UI is a React application written in Typescript.

We use `yarn` as the package manager, if adding dependencies to `package.json`
make sure you install them with `yarn` and commit the `yarn.lock` file.

=== Running Kiali Frontend

When developing, it is typical to run the frontend outside of the kiali server in the cluster.

It is possible to proxy the API requests without having to push the changes to kiali.
Add the link:https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#proxying-api-requests-in-development[proxy]
property to `package.json` with the url of kiali.
[source, json]
----
{
  "proxy": "http://localhost:20001",
  "name": "@kiali/kiali-ui",
  "version": "1.82.0",
}
----

If Kiali is configured with a specific web root, make sure to append it to the URL. On many setups with Kubernetes, the web root will be `/kiali` by default.

Run `yarn start` and try it!

=== Internationalization (i18n)

Kiali supports internationalization with the `react-i18next` library. String literals to be translated are added automatically to a locale file (stored in `public/locales/<language>/translation.json`), during the development phase, with `i18n-parser` (executed along with `yarn start` or `yarn build` command). At runtime, the i18n library will use these locale files to perform translation to a specific language. 

**Adding a new language**

These are the steps to add a new language to Kiali:

1. Add a new language entry in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/frontend/src/types/Common.ts[`common type`] enum `Language`.

[source, typescript]
----
export const enum Language {
  CHINESE = 'zh',
  ENGLISH = 'en'
  // Add new language entry here
}
----

2. Add a new select entry for the new language in the component link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/frontend/src/components/Nav/Masthead/LanguageSwitch.tsx[`LanguageSwitch.tsx`]

[source, typescript]
----
<DropdownItem key="Chinese" onClick={() => switchLanguage(Language.CHINESE)}>
  <span>中文</span>
  {language === Language.CHINESE && <KialiIcon.Check className={checkStyle} />}
</DropdownItem>
----

If possible, include a new language test case scenario in the language selector unit test `LanguageSwitch.test.tsx`.

3. Add the new language in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/frontend/i18next-parser.config.ts[`i18next-parser.config.ts`] file so that the `i18n-parser` generates the locale file for the new language.

[source, typescript]
----
locales: ['en', 'zh', /* add new language code here */],
----

3. Execute `yarn build` to generate the new locale file.
4. Modify the generated locale file as outlined in the next section.

**Modify an existing language translation**

The locale files are stored in `public/locales/<language>/translation.json`. If you find a wrong translation or an English statement (default value when the label is generated), simply modify that file to include the correct language translation.

**Add i18n support to a React component**

The way to adapt a React component to the i18n framework depends on its type:

- **React class:**

Use the `t` function imported from `utils/i18nUtils`. **Important:** Don't import the `t` function from 'i18next' library; always import it from `utils/i18nUtils`.

Any label (variable or string literal) can be translated with the `t` function within the component.

[source, typescript]
----
import { t } from 'utils/I18nUtils';

title = t('Traffic Graph');
----

In some React classes, labels are not translated on initial load or when the language changes. If this happens, add the language to Redux properties to force the component to re-render when the language is updated.

[source, typescript]
----
type ReduxProps = {
  language: string;
};

const mapStateToProps = (state: KialiAppState): ReduxProps => ({
  language: languageSelector(state)
});
----


- **React hook:**

Use the `useKialiTranslation` hook from `utils/i18nUtils` to get the `t` translation function. This is simply a wrapper for the `useTranslation` hook that includes the Kiali namespace. More info link:https://react.i18next.com/latest/usetranslation-hook[here].

[source, typescript]
----
const { t } = useKialiTranslation();

<h1>{t(title)}</h1>
----

- **External variable:**

String literals that are stored in a variable defined outside of a React component cannot be translated directly. Instead, the translation has to be done when the variable is used within the React component (class, hook or external function).

The problem is that the i18n parser can't extract labels from variables, only from literals. To indicate to the i18n parser to add that kind of string literal to the locale file, use the `t` function imported from `utils/i18nUtils`. Note that in this context, the `t` function does not perform any translation; it returns the same string literal at runtime, so it is used for development purposes only.

[source, typescript]
----
import { t } from 'utils/I18nUtils';

const overviewTypes = {
  app: t('Apps'),
  workload: t('Workloads'),
  service: t('Services')
};


const Example: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  const { t } = useKialiTranslation();

  return (
    <span>{t(overviewTypes.app)}</span>
    ...
  )
}
----

- **External function:**

External functions can use the `t` function imported from `utils/i18nUtils` to perform the translations like in React classes or external variables.

[source, typescript]
----
import { t } from 'utils/I18nUtils';

const externalFunction = (): React.ReactNode => {
  return (
    ...
      <div>{`${t('Label')}:`}</div>
    ...
  )
}

const Example: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <Tooltip position={TooltipPosition.top} content={externalFunction()}>
    ...
    </Tooltip>
  )
}

----

**Special i18n cases:**

- **Interpolation:**

You can include any variable value within the translated statement with interpolation. More info link:https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/interpolation[here]

[source, typescript]
----
<div>{t('Kiali home cluster: {{clusterName}}', { clusterName: homeCluster?.name })}</div>
----

The variables are represented with `{{$variable}}`. You can set any name to the variable, you have just to be sure that it matches the json field.

This is how it looks like in the translation file:

[source, json]
----
"Kiali home cluster: {{clusterName}}": "Kiali主集群: {{clusterName}}",
----

- **Plurals:**

When a statement is different in singular and plural, you can use `defaultValue_one` and `defaultValue_other` fields to add different plural statements (no need to add 's' manually anymore). Note that in this case the variable name must be `count`. For convenience the key will be the singular statement. More info link:https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/plurals[here]

[source, typescript]
----
labelsInfo = t('{{count}} label', {
        count: labelsLength,
        defaultValue_one: '{{count}} label',
        defaultValue_other: '{{count}} labels'
      });
----

=== Integration Testing

Integration testing is done with cypress. More information can be found link:./cypress/README.md[here].

=== Styling
https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly] is the main UI components framework. It defines style based on SASS preprocessor.
All Patternfly build assets are imported from patternfly library.

Kiali uses two ways to add custom styles to any React component:

1. https://typestyle.github.io/[Typestyle]: Define dynamic styling with Typescript in a declarative, conflict-free and reusable way

2. https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules[CSS Modules]: CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally.

All styles defined by these two approaches are scoped to their respective component, providing encapsulation without affecting any styling defined outside of the component.

Recommended option in Kiali is Typestyle since it provides more flexibility and utilities than CSS modules. In case of big CSS styles (e.g. slider component) or definition of CSS variables (not supported by Typestyle), then CSS modules is the preferred method.

=== Style Code Guide

See the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.adoc#frontend-typescript[STYLE CODE GUIDE file].

=== Testing
To run the tests, the standard command `yarn test` is valid,
but since some tests are using link:https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html[snapshots] the preferred command is to update them in the same time:
[source,shell]
----
yarn test -u
----

Then hit `a` to run all tests.

After running the tests, if any snapshot has been modified (check git status),
the diff should be reviewed to make sure it's an intentional or trivial change.
Modified snapshots must be part of the commit so that they're reviewed collectively and won't make CI build fail.

Note: for OS/X users testing requires watchman to be installed
[source,shell]
----
brew install watchman
----

== Testing Libraries for Vulnerabilities
We use github Dependabot for vulnerability testing. Dependabot runs regularly on the `kiali/kiali` repository.

== Production Builds
Use `yarn build` which will bundle the build artifacts using webpack into the `build` directory.
